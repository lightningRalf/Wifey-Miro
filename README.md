  <summary>Bear Market Rally - Summary</summary>
  
[Bear Market Rally - Thread](https://twitter.com/WifeyAlpha/status/1539966248787886080)
## 1. What are **B**ear **M**arket **R**allies = **BMR**?
BMR are secondary reactions in the opposite direction of the primary trend. The primary trend in bear markets is down. BMR tend to be short covering rallies and at times when aggressive downward moves become exhausted.

BMR are market bids over +5%

## 2. Expected BMR length and peak

2008 GFC top BMRs 24%, 19%, 12%, 12% & 11%

Dot Com top BMRs 21%, 21%, 21%, 19% & 15%

These were not inflationary bear markets but they have the most similar structure from market participants perspective

Can last quarters & seem like regime change

## 3. How to trade BMR start & end
Start: Technicals can overpower fundamentals in the short-term & cause brutal rallies. Exhaustion and overextension are prerequisites. 

End: [Market dullness quote tweet](https://twitter.com/wifeyalpha/status/1533107847571156993?s=21&t=NCHhthT5k_Oaold5d4Oa1Q) 
BMR can bid & retrace 50% of the original down move.

## 4. How to prepare for BMR
